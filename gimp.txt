resolution: 72 ppi is default and very bad for printing, 100-200 noticeble, >300 is very good
zoom: left bottom corner %
coordinate: left top is (0,0), and y axis is to bottom and x axis is to right
scale: stretched and squashed if arbitrarily
alpha value=0, transparent(transparency), value=255, opaque(opacity)
		255=2 power 8

parasite such as comment
when open an image, check header of the image first, if not successful, resort to using extension
new image: only rgb or grayscale
  we can convert it to indexed by image->mode->indexed

copy screen to gimp: double screen: "print scrn" then "create from clipboard" sometimes copy the middle of 2 screens
  if copy main screen, use ALT+"PrintScrn", then "create from clipboard"

  make a selection partially transparent:   
    method1: create a selection, select->float, set opacity, 
											click anywhere outside the selection( a select tool must be active)
    method2: create a selection, ctr+x, ctr+v (cut then paste), set opacity, 
			click anywhere outside the selection( a select tool must be active)
     			
rgb/cmy(k), grayscale, indexed

scale/move a selection:
create a seletion, scale or move,  cut or paste the selection,
click anywhere outside the selection( a select tool must be active)

draw a line: 

image
resolution
color channel, filter on channel, channel mask
layers (a sheaf of transparent papers one on top of the other)
selection (marching ants)  is represented by a full-fledged grayscale channel, 
		the dashed line is simply a contour line at the 50%-selected level. 

(tool), (layer, path, channel, undo), (brush, pattern, gradient)

feather: select->feather->fill radius

change image mode: image->mode
rotate, scale
FLIP: ctr can switch between horizontal and vertical
ctr+I: invert a selection
Shift+Q: toggle quickmask
ctrl+pageup/pagedown: switch between tabs
shift+f10: open the menu
ctrl+j or ctrl+shift+j: adapt image size to window size and vice versa
edit->preferences

selection: shift: add, ctr: subtract, shift+ctr: intersect
           shift+alt: move
